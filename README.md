# LPNtestbench
Notebook to test LPN:

The notebook name is called neural_net.ipynb, and the code to test the decision tree is neural_net.py.

To view the experiments done, unzip experiments.txt, go to each experiment folder. secret.json denotes the A, b', s, and p used for each experiment.

Parametric.json denotes the nerual network used for the experiment

training.txt shows the accuracies on different datasets every 50 epochs. 

paracrypt.pth is the model weights.
